            I'm putting John in charge of the Smith account.

            We've started a new services account at Intelli-Soft.

            ACCOUNT[+event]
            The act of giving a report.  The act of informing verbally.

            John's exciting account of the car crash had his listeners on the edges of their seats!
            Give me a brief account of what you've been doing.
            I'm sorry, sir, but I think that the account of my activities would take all night.
            The moon, by my account, was full and bright that night.

            A record or a description.  Does not refer to the event of verbally giving the report.  Not bounded by time in any way.
            If you are unclear about whether a report is a verbal event or not, you should probably select this sense.

        <examples>
            The official account of the crash omitted a number of details.
            For a historical account of the Battle of Waterloo, check your textbook.
            A short news account contained a transcript of the senator's speech.
            Unfortunately, the two witnesses had conflicting accounts of the crime.
