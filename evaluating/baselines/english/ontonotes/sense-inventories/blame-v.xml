            NOTE: The cause/blamed is not necessarily responsible for the outcome. The accuser
            assigns this responsibilty (probably based on circumstance or evidence). Note that unlike
            in sense 2, negation will take away the cause:
            &quot;I didn't blame the mess in the kitchen on John.&quot;  = John did not make the mess.

            NP[+agent] BLAME NP[+recipient] PP[+attribute/action]
            NOTE: unlike sense 1, a specific cause may not be given here
            NOTE: Although it is often used in the negative, it is clear that the recipient
            possesses or shows the attribute.  Unlike in sense 1, negating the sentence does
            not take away the attribute:
            &quot;I don't blame Sally for being mad,&quot; does not mean that she isn't mad.  She is.

            The critics blamed the film for being violent.
            I don't blame Sally for being mad about this.
