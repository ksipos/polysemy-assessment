            Syntax Is:  NP1[agent] BLESS NP2[patient]
            
            NOTE: the NP2 is gaining the property 'holy or sacred' but no other
            attributes or qualities are transfered onto NP2. Unless, like in
            the last example, the NP1 is merely granting permission to something.
