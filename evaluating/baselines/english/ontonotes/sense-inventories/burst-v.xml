        <commentary>
            Syntax Includes:
            NP1[patient[concrete]] BURST
            NP1[theme[concrete]] BURST PP[directional]
            NP1[agent] BURST NP2[patient]
            
            NOTE: Compare to sense 2. This sense implies a container that is
            bursting or something bursting OUT of a container. Can include
            metaphorical instances if a container is somehow implied. Also refers
            to being in a state close to bursting.  Includes transitive usages,
            (i.e., "Don't burst my bubble, seriously.)

            NOTE: Could imply an emotional outburst. Compare to Sense 1: in Sense
            2, there is no container implied. Involves perception, not
            movement. This sense involves a change of state or emotion.
