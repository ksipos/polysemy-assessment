            I got back fifty cents in change from my twenty.
            A dollar of that currency is worth about three cents in ours.
            They are selling out the old inventory for twenty cents on the dollar.

            Here is a cent that was minted in 1919.
            I have two dimes and three cents in my pocket.
            This rare never-circulated cent is now worth about two hundred dollars.
