            Syntax Is:
            NP1[agent[human]] COMMAND NP2[patient[plural]
            
            NOTE: PATIENT may be animate or inanimate. [+human] can be an
            organization made of human entities (like sentence 3). NP2 CANNOT be a count noun like
            'dog' (cannot be split up into smaller components) but must be a
            mass noun like 'company' or 'budget' (can be split up into smaller
            components) or a plural noun like 'dogs'.

            Syntax Is:
            NP1[agent[human]] COMMAND NP2[patient[human]] 
            NOTE: may take passive voice. Agent might not be explicit (see
            example 3). In rare cases, the agent can be [-animate] as in example
            4, but in these cases the agent is seen to be personified (or rather
            'made animate').
