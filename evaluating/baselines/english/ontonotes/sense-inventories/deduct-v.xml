            The tenant might have deducted the amount from his rent.
            Your account is usually deducted the amount of miles you sold.
            It's just a card which you add credit to and it then deducts some every time you use it.

            The viewer deducted that this target was related to a war of wits.
            Well, I have deducted that Kentucky Wonders are pole beans but not all pole beans are KW's.
            I think it's virtually impossible to deduct how a particular person will act in this situation.
