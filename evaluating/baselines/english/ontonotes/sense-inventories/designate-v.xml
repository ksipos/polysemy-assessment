            Syntax Includes:
            NP1[agent] DESIGNATE NP2[theme] (NP[attribute])
            NP1[agent] DESIGNATE NP2[theme] (ADVP)
            NOTE: compare carefully to sense 2. This sense only refers to
            assigning a formal, quotable name or title. You should be able to put the
            name in front of the NP2 (usually separate the 2 with BE)
            like: 'Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard is the highway...'
            You can't do this with the examples in sense 2.
            Name or title may be a single word or a phrase that constitutes a
            title, but must be an actual name, not just a discriptor.

            Syntax Includes:
            NP1[agent] DESIGNATE NP2 TO VP
            NP1[agent] DESIGNATE NP2 TO NP

            NP1[agent] DESIGNATE NP2 PP{for NP}
            
            NOTE: In some cases, the thing being designated may look like it's
            being named (usually in examples with 'as' following the verb,
            sometimes in single or double quotes) but the order of the NP and
            the descriptor cannot be reversed as described in sense 1.
