            NOTE: Nothing is necessarily getting removed from the container,
            except as a result (not intentional action) of the dipping, as in
            example 2.

            NOTE: compare carefully to sense 6; in this sense, you must state the 
            substance being removed.  Ie, 'He dipped into the container' does not
            entail that water was removed. Also, the 'source' is a location, not 
            a resource.

            Enron dipped into reserves to drive up earnings.
