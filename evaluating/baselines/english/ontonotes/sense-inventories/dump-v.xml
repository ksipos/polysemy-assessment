            Note: Although this sense may or may not involve something being dropped, 
            an essential part of its meaning is getting rid of something unwanted.
            Note: This sense also includes selling unwanted goods cheaply as a way of
            getting rid of them.

            Note: the relationship could be romantic or otherwise. This sense also has
            the notion of 'getting rid of unwanted item', but it's more than that since
