            Note: This sense refers to an item that is independantly separated
            from all other items like a coin or a pork chop. Can include a path
            of motion where NP2 moves from one point to another.

            NOTE: This sense refers to items that are attached to a larger mass
            like a light switch or a page in a book. Can include an implied
            path of motion (as in turning pages in a book) but the location of
            NP2 does not fundamentally change.

            Note: NP2 can be [+concrete] only if it's reversing direction not
            'turning over'. Also NOTE: FLIP-FLOP should be tagged as NOA
            because it is related to the verb 'flop' NOT 'flip.'
