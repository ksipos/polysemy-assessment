            Includes: GUARD AGAINST
            Syntax Is: NP1[agent] GUARD NP2[patient[concrete]] (PP{against NP})
            Note: NP2 can sometimes be a location, but it still needs to be
            [+concrete] and when you use GUARD AGAINST, the third NP must be a threat
            that is [+concrete]. When NP2 is a location, this sense applies to
            BOTH keeping things in and keeping them out.
