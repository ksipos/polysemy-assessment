            They walk in procession, herded by the tubby, beaming old parson. 
            They found themselves being herded with sticks into the camp.

            Their sheep will be herded into the fields after the harvest. 
            The guerrillas herded together the unwounded soldiers. 
            The guards herded their group toward a small, unremarkable building. 
            Gereint herded them all into the horse barn.
