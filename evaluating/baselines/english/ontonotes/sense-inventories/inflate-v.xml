            NOTE: compare carefully to sense 1; although both can be quantitative,
            this sense does not include &quot;filling.&quot; This sense also
            applies to a misrepresentation of the object inflated and
            involves an intent to deceive. Also, compare to
            sense 4; this sense does not apply to any instances of price
            or curreny inflation.
