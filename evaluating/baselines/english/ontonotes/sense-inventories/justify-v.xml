        FN Frame Deserving vs. Justifying differ only in terms of whether or not an Agent 
        is held responsible for the act needing justification.  Justifying covers such
        cases.  Deserving is for cases where the state of affairs thought to warrant
        an action are part of an external scene.  Most of the senses' examples listed
        here do not easily distingish between the two, so I included them both.
