            Syntax Is: NP1[agent] LURK
            Note: NP1 does not have to be [animate] but must be construed as an
            agent or actor. See example 4.

            High school students like to lurk around in Central Square.
            Who is this man lurking around the department?
            John lurks in dark corners, hoping to frighten Mary.
            Rocks lurked everywhere in the dark, threatening to trip me.

            Syntax Is: NP1[theme] LURK
            Note: NP1 is often abstract.
            Note: NP1 cannot be an agent; in example 2 below, for instance,
            stocks do not move of their own accord.

            Fear lurks at the back of my mind.
