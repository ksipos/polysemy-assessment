            Syntax Includes:
            NP1 MANIFEST NP2[patient[concrete]]
            NP1[agent] MANIFEST
            Note: May be reflexive.   
            Note: See final example. Unlike in Sense 1, the NP2 in Sense 2
            becomes [concrete] by the action of the verb and thus may be
            considered concrete in the syntax.
