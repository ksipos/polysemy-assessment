            NOTE: MOTIVATE precedes action of another verb.  Also, pay careful
            attention to passive uses of this verb.  If you are unsure which
            sense a passive sentence belongs in, convert it into an active voice.
            For example, sentence 4 could be seen as 'A sports fantasy motivated
            Michael Jordan to contiue his career.'
