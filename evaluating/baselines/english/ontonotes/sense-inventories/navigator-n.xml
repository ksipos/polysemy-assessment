            John's father served as navigator on a B-24 during World War II.
            We got to meet the ship's navigator on a tour of the cruise ship.
            The navigators on ships during past centuries guarded their knowledge carefully.
            The pilot had to fly using dead reckoning after his navigator became incapacitated.

            Note: usually refers to individuals from past centuries
            Note: implies the navigator was also captain of the ship, thus differing from Sense 1 above

            Henry Hudson was an early English navigator of North America.
            The 15th and 16th century Portuguese navigators explored much of the world by sea.
            That boy is the youngest navigator to sail around the globe single-handedly.

            Bob uses a GPS as the onboard navigator of his 50-foot sailboat.
