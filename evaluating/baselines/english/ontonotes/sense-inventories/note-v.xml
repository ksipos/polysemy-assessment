            Note: CAREFUL:
            The text must indicate in some way that writing is involved
            in order for you to select this sense! Ex: &quot;She noted everything he said,&quot; should 
            be tagged as sense 1; &quot;She noted everything he said *in her diary*&quot; would be 
            tagged as sense 2.

        <examples>
            She noted everything he said in her small diary.
            You'd better note this down unless your memory is really good!
