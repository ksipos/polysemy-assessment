        <commentary>
            NOTE: This verb is prone to ambiguous sentences like 'I am going to
            go paint.' where no other information is given so it could be
            tagged at sense 1 or sense 2. If you come across an instance that
            is TRULY ambiguous, please tag it a both sense 1 and sense
            2. However, if you believe an instance fits better in one sense than
            another (as in examples 1 and 3 in this sense) please choose the
            most likely sense.

            NOTE: This sense also could have some ambiguity as in example 2.
            If there is no more context for example 2, it potentially could be ambiguous.

            Syntax Is: NP1 PAINT A PICTURE of NP2[patient[abstract]]
            NOTE: Only metaphorical uses, so the sentence 'Paint a picture of
            that chair.' would be in sense 1.
