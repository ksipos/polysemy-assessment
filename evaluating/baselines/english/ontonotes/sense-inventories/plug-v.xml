            The beginning was awful but I plugged away at the book hoping
            that it redeem itself in the end.
            I plugged away into the maelstrom and gradually drew closer to the
            Island.
            I plugged away at the game whenever I could squeeze an hour away
            from my job.

            Tinman plugged the German's plane full of holes.
            He was probably lucky she hadn't plugged him full of buckshot.
            I plugged him in the back of the head and claimed my bounty.
