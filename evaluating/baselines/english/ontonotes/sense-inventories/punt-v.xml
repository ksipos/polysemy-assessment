            He punted the ball from one end zone to the other.
            And then, he picked up the tote bag and drop-kick-punted it out the door.
            He correctly calculated that if he punted, the offense was likely to beat his defense.
            You don't punt Goblins because they'll run your ass over with a go-kart.
            Obama punted the nuclear football!!!
            Democrats punt on the war bill.

            The boatman punted the boat away from shore and began rowing it forward.
            Gilgamesh punted the boat along.
            They punted up the river.
            Milo punted the gondola under a bridge and into a wide area.
            He heard small splashes, as though someone were punting the gondola across the water.
            I'd weathered Waterworld, and now, they were going to punt the whole thing across dry land?

            He punted the lot on Little Nell in the third race.
            He has probably punted $10 million over the years by being a lousy gambler.
            I punted $10k on the Dragons but my balance only shows a drop of $10k and no winnings!!
            This is a horse race, I've punted $10, end of analogy.
            Anybody that prefers value here is only punting $2 eachway.
