            She reclined her head on the pillow.
            There were plenty of soft cushions and carved benches to recline upon.
            As I recline, my head says more or less vertical.
            If only I could keep the person in front of me from reclining back into my spleen.
            The seat reclines to a full 160 degrees to provide the most comfortable sitting position possible.
