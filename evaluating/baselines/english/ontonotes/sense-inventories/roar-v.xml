            Syntax Includes:
            NP1[theme[inanimate]] ROAR (ADVP[manner]) PP[directional]
            NP1[agent[animate]] ROAR (ADVP[manner]) PP[directional]
            
            Includes: ROAR OFF
            
            NOTE: in this sense 'roar' does not JUST refer to the sound an NP
            makes but also (in the case of an animate NP1) the manner in which
            NP1 moves.
