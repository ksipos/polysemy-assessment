            Syntax is: NP1 [theme] SMELL
            NOTE: Carefully compare to senses 4 and 6
            In this sense, the quality of the smell is irrelevant;
            there is only a general emittance of odor
            This sense is almost always used with negatives and questions.
            (compare the negative for this sense--doesn't smell=no odor--
            to the negative for sense 6--doesn't smell=doesn't stink)
