            He stalked the family before entering the house in mid-May 2005.
            He knew Dee Borah would track him down like a cat stalking the
            wilds for food.
            The girl said he stalked her for years with sexually violent
            messages before pushing his way into her house.

            So again he stalked away, neither staying nor caring for responses.
            Richard saw her smile, her bright eyes, the instant he stalked in.
            He stalked through the sitting room, smiling with false affability
            at his guests and scarcely noticing that they cowered when he spoke
            to them.
