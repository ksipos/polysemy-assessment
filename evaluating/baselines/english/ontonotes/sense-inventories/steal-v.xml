            Syntax includes: NP1 STEAL NP2
            NP1 STEAL AWAY/OUT PP
            Note: In this sense, STEAL usually is accompanied by a nominalized verb (verb-made-noun).
            Also note that the NP2 (what is stolen) cannot come into existence before the action of
            stealing (as opposed to things like wallets, hearts, or memories that exist even before
            the actual act of stealing).
            Note: The last two examples in this set specifically means &quot;to move or carry stealthily&quot;.
