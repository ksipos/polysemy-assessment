            Syntax is: NP1[agent] SUBSTITUTE NP2[theme] (FOR/INTO NP3[theme].)
            Note: An agent manipulates a theme.

            Syntax is: NP1[theme] SUBSTITUTE NP2[theme].
            Note: An agent in this case (see final example) is also the theme of the argument (the thing substituting).
