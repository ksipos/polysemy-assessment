            Allow me to make a suggestion: stop wearing that ugly tie.

            We ordered the boiled beef, which was the waiter's suggestion.

            SUGGESTION[+event]
            The act of making a suggestion; a proposal.  Can also be an act of persuasion.
            There is no idea that can be directly linked to the word.  Usually general and vague.
