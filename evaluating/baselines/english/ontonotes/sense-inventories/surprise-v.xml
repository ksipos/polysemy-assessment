            Note: Unlike sense 1, the circumstances of the 'surprise' are not improbable.
            For example, in the case of 'robbers were surprised by the police',
            police catching robbers is not an unexpected event.

        <examples>
            The robbers had just opened the safe when they were surprised by the police.
            I surprised a huge raccoon going through the garbage last night. 
            I surprised my roommate and her boyfriend on the couch last night.
            He surprised me with flowers.
