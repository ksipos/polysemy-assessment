            Syntax is: NP1 SUSTAIN NP2[benefactor] (PP[manner/durative])
            NP1[agent] SUSTAIN NP2[event/state]
            NOTE: It may be difficult to distinguish between a sustained benefactor
            and sustained event or state (which may be metaphorically interpreted
            as a benefactor); thus, this sense includes both frames mentioned above.
