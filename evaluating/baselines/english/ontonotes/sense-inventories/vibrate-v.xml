            Syntax Includes:
            NP1[agent] VIBRATE NP2[patient[concrete]]
            NP1[theme[concrete]] VIBRATE PP[directional]
            Note: Thing vibrating must be concrete; even in the example of 'air',
            it is the molecules of air that vibrate and thus it is concrete; this
            does not mean that the stimulus/agent has to be concrete, however.
