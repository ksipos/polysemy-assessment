            Syntax is: NP1[agent] WEAVE NP2[+plural/first component] (IN/INTO/WITH NP3[second component])
            
            NOTE: Compare to sense 2. This sense involves two or more items
            being weaved together (and the method), the end product is not the
            focus nor does it need to be stated. As in the 2nd sentence, the 'ribbon' is the
            patient, the basket is the object.
