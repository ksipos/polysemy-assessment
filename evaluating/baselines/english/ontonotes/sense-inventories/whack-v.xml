            NOTE: compare carefully to sense 2.  This sense may include instances 
            of WHACK NP PP[+directional (off)]
            Remember that with these instances, you cannot move the NP after the PP:
            Ex: The taxi whacked him off his scooter.
            *The taxi whacked off him his scooter.
            Compare to Sense 2: Instances that do not originally contain [+directional (off)] will not be able to take the particle:
            The hitter whacked the ball.
            * The hitter whacked off the ball./The hitter whacked the
            ball off.

            Is: WHACK OFF (no sexual connotations)
            NOTE: compare carefully to sense 1; in the VPC use,
            the NP can split the verb and particle, or appear after the particle:
            Ex: The salesman whacked twenty percent off.
            The salesman whacked off twenty percent.
