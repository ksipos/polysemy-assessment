            The narrow channel was wharfed with a wall of a brick to keep the bank from falling in.
            I cannot but remark how we wharfed the banks.
            Of the 7.7 miles of frontage referred to, less than 2 miles is wharfed.
            He sought to improve this by wharfing the river-front.
