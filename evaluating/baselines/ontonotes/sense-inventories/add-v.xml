            NOTE: Throughout this task, please beware of adjectival usages, such
            as &quot;added value&quot;(adj+noun)--but note that &quot;added value&quot; may also
            be a verb+object (sense 3).  Please decide carefully, and tag &quot;X&quot; for adjectives.
            NOTE: Compare carefully to sense 2; in this sense, a unit is given to an entity, a 
            portion is given to a total.  In sense 2, parts 1 and 2 are combined to create
            the entity. 
            Syntax Includes:

            In stocks:
            NP1[financial institution] ADD NP2[numerical value] to NP3[total worth]
