            John's allergies are worse when there is lots of pollen in the air.
            The patient had no known allergy to sulfa drugs.
            She developed an allergy to the loud, overbearing manager. (metaphoric extension, here it means a dislike, antipathy - it's not broad enough usage to warrant a separate meaning, though.)
