            Note: Metaphorical use: Come close as in appearance, quality, or condition
            Note: Please compare carefully to sense 3. In this sense, one could
            not substitute &quot;treat&quot; for &quot;approach&quot;, while in most cases of sense 3,
            such a substitution would be possible.
