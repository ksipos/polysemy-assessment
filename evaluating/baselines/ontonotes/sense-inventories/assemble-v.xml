        These senses are left separate b/c in all three FN/VN/PB databases there
        are specific mappings for both senses.

    <sense group="1" n="1" name="create a new entity by putting components or members together" type="">
        <commentary>
            Syntax Is: NP1[animate] ASSEMBLE NP2[singular,object created] (FROM/WITH NP3[plural,individual
            members of collection])
            NOTE: The object created MUST BE specified while the components may or may
            not be specified. Also, compare carefully to sense 2, the object
            created must be a named entity and thus you could not break up the
            entity and call the individual components by the same name. For
            example, in the last sentence, the parts of a bicycle each have
            individual names.

            The team assembled the first 10 units by hand with the system's many custom components.
            The U.S. military has assembled the world's most formidable Hacker Posse (from the best scientists at MIT.)
            I assembled the bicycle from parts of 10 broken ones.

        <commentary>
            Syntax Is:  NP1[agent] ASSEMBLE (NP2[theme[plural]]) (PP)
            NOTE: If the sentence has no NP2, then NP1 will be the individual
            units as in example 2. Also, compare carefully to sense 1, none of
            the NP's purposes or qualities are altered as a result of the
            assembly process. 
            NOTE: The individual units assembled together do not get a
            different name because they are grouped together. Compare to Sense 1.
