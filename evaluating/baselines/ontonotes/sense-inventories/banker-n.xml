            John's father is an investment banker.
            That printing shop seems to keep bankers' hours.
            I had them write me a banker's check.

            Sally will be the banker for our Monopoly game.
            John's friends say he cheats when he's the banker in board games.
            The banker deals each player two thousand dollars at the beginning of the game.
