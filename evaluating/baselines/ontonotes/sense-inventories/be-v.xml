            NOTE:  In this sense, the predicate describes the subject--it is not equal to the subject.
            ie, this is NOT NP1 = NP2.  You CANNOT change the NPs around.
            Ex:  He is a resident neurosurgeon.
            **(not okay) A resident neurosurgeon is him.
            If switching the NPs makes the sentence weird, then it belongs here (and not sense 2)
            This sense includes copula usage, e.g. 'she is pretty'

            John is rich
            A dog is a mammal.
            He is a resident neurosurgeon.
            Maria Callas was Tosca in that production at La Scala.
            There is an indication of linkage.
            Those are signs of strength in our economy.

            NP1 = NP2
            Compare to sense 1; in this sense, you CAN switch the NPs around
            So, you can say 'Our' resident philosopher is her.  BUT NOT 'A' resident philospher is her.

            The network is the computer.
            She is our resident philosopher.

            Usually of the form THERE + BE (finite)
            Compare to sense 3; the thing &quot;being&quot; here is 
            an event, not an entity.
            Note: does not indicate having an ongoing existence like sense #3 - is more temporary
            Example: 'There is a play this weekend' does not indicate a permanent state, it indicates
            something that will occur, and then end.
