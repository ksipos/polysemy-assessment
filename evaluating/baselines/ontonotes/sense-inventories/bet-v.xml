            Includes: BET ON
            NOTE: this may be interpreted as a subset of sense 2; if money is involved
            this sense should be chosen (naturally, the better may often feel
            certain that what they are betting on is true or will occur)
            NOTE: this is only if money or valuable item is wagered or gambled

            No gambling is implied. No money or goods are wagered.
            The subject is usually (but not always) in 1st person.
