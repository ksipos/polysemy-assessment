            INCLUDES: CLICK OPEN, CLICK ON, CLICK SHUT
            Syntax Is:
            NP1[agent] CLICK NP[patient]
            NP1[theme] CLICK PP
            
            NOTE: The clicking sound results as a symptom of turning on or off
            operation but the emphasis is on the movment or start of operation of
