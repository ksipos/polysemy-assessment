            Syntax Is:
            NP1[agent] CONDEMN NP2[theme] to NP3[goal]
            NOTE: compare to sense 1; these senses are related, but
            the NP2 in this sense may not necessarily be guilty
            but may be a victim of circumstance. Also the state/punisment
            NP is required for a sentence to fit into this sense.
