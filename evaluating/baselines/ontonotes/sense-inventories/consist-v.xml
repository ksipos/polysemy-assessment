            NP1[topic] CONSIST PP{OF/IN NP2[attribute]}
            Note:(might be paraphrased as, &quot;Basically, NP1 is (or is due to) NP2.&quot;)
            Note: the focus is on a state or attribute inherent or central to the topic. Unlike 
            sense 2, NP2 could be considered as the key or necessary ingredient to NP1.
            NOTE: The key attribute or state mentioned (NP2) is adequate to summarize NP1 (although it may
            not be the entire content of NP1).  This is not always the case in sense 2, 
            where if only one part is mentioned, it does not adequately summarize the whole.

            Note: the topic is a whole made from the parts. Unlike sense 1, the NP2s are not the
            central attributes for NP1. They are just one of the many pieces that make up NP1.
            NOTE: If the entire list of parts is given, NP1 will be completely described, but if only 
            a portion is given, NP1 is not completely described (ie, you couldn't say, &quot;Basically,
            Internet content is material unsuitable for children.&quot; That material is only a portion of the 
            content, not a defining characteristic.)
