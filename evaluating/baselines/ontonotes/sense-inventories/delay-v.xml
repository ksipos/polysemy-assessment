            Syntax Is:
            NP1 DELAY NP2
            Note: implies an slowing of a process without a set, determined endpoint
            (although there are stages in a child's development, there is no final &quot;aha, developed!&quot; end;
            bad commuter traffic never seems to end, delayed or not)
            Note: There is no specific endpoint!

            Note: compare to sense 1; in this sense, there is an implied time at which an event should
            occur.  (Negotiations are a scheduled event; in &quot;I was delayed&quot; there is an inferred expected
            time that &quot;I&quot; should have left the office)
            Note: There is a specific endpoint! May be obvious or implied.
