            NOTE: compare carefully to sense 2; in this sense, the dissolved entity
            is broken down, and often absorbed by a medium
            Note: Usually refers to a liquid medium, but not always
            Note: May be used metaphorically but the medium must be present in the sentence.

            NOTE: compare carefully to sense 1; in this sense, the entity dissolves becomes the 
            resulting entity (not merely a part of it, or merely absorbed
            into it); the resulting entity must be named in the sentence.

            NOTE: In this sense, the dissolved entity is not absorbed as a part of the
            medium, but disappears
            May be used metaphorically

            NP1[patient[human[plural]]] DISSOLVE
            NP1[agent] DISSOLVE NP2[patient[human[plural]]]
            NOTE: compare carefully to sense 1; in this sense, the resulting state is separate components,
            (ie, 'ethnic enclaves') not an encompassing situation (ie, 'apathy and drowsiness'.)
            Also, this sense refers specifically to the cessation of function or organization and the unit must be implied or named.
