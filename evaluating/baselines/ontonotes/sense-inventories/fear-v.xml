            Syntax Is: NP1[experiencer] FEAR NP2[stimulus]
            Note: This sense implies a more specific version of sense 2. That is, one who is 
            scared or frightened will most likely also be anxious, uneasy or apprehensive about 
            the very thing they fear. But this sense implies feeling scared and in danger, 
            which second sense lacks.
