            NOTE: IMPORTANT - Tag instances with HAVE TO and HAVE + VERB[past tense] as
            'None of the Above'. Examples: 'I have to go to the store.' and 'I have gone to
            the store already.' and 'I had shopped at the Quickie-Mart only once.' In these examples HAVE is an auxiliary verb
            and must be tagged 'None of the Above'.
            Once you give the thing away, you no longer have it.
