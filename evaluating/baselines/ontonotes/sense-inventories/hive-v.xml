            The bees hived up that honey.
            I had hived away a collection of empty plastic water bottles. 
            Always check your air cleaner if it's been hived away.
            The recordings are hived away for improper use.

            They hived off to form their own covens.
            They hived them as two colonies.
            They hived off key assets, such as the lease-car business.
            At least 50000 bees hived within the walls of one of our rooms.
            Honey bees hived in a prototypic pollination unit.
            If you moved them when you hived the first swarm, they'll swarm again.
