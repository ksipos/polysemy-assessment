            At least 11 worshippers were killed and dozens wounded when
            suspected militants hurled grenades into a mosque in northwest
            Pakistan during Wednesday evening prayers, an official said.
            He hurled at Aias with his bright spear.
            He laughed, hurled insults and kicked me as I lay on the street sobbing.
