    <sense group="1" n="1" name="interfere with someone else's activity" type="">  
        <commentary>
            Syntax Is: NP1[agent] INTERRUPT NP2[patient[animate]] (PP)
            NOTE: NP2 must be affected by the verb; the activity cannot be the
            core argument affected (the patient). Compare to Sense 2, where the
            opposite is true.
            NOTE: Use this sense for interrupted speech, as in conversation.

        <commentary>
            Syntax Is: NP1[agent] INTERRUPT NP2[patient]
            NOTE: The activity interrupted may or may not continue when the
            interruption is over.
            NOTE: Compare to Sense 1; in Sense 2, the activity, not the
            person/group, is directly affected by the verb.
