<!-- 
  the inventory's lemma attribute should take the form: word_stem-[nva]

<!ELEMENT commentary (#PCDATA)>

<!-- 
(optional) unstructured commentary to be seen by the annotators.  Can be at the word-level
or at the sense-level.  Can include things like:  a long technical definition, explicit
guidance on distinguishing close senses, verb-frames, etc.

  n CDATA #REQUIRED

<!--
  id = the number ID of the sense
  type = the type of the sense (e.g. concrete, abstract, technical, archaic, event)
  name = a clear and concise description of the sense (for the annotators)
  group = A group identifier: this allows very coarse clustering of the senses.
         used, for example, distinguish homographs (fan the blows air vs. football fan)
         and to cluster closely related senses (e.g. school as building & school as process
         vs. school of fish)

<!ELEMENT examples (#PCDATA)>

<!--
  examples that illustrate which common patterns of usage fall under this sense.
  should include helpful boundary cases and idiomatic expressions.
  NOTE: each example should be separated by a newline character.
