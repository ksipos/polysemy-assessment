            Syntax Is: NP1[agent] LINK NP2[patient] (TO NP3[recipient])
            Includes: LINK UP
            Note: Unlike sense 2, sense 1 implies an establishment of a relation
            between or among two or more entities. The entities mentioned MUST be related
            in some relationship.
            Note: NP1 is the actor that causes or does the linking.

            Includes: LINK UP
            Note: In this sense, the linking does not at all imply a relationship between/among the 
            entities linked. If there is a logical or causal relationship, then choose sense 1.
            Note: This sense usually refers to electronic, technical, or physical joining
            of two unrelated things by a third thing (a media; the link itself).
