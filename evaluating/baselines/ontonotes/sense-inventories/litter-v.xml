            Not only is Steve annoying, but he litters!
            He littered the floor with all his football gear.
            He littered his new place with those same old heartaches.
            Maybe he littered sweetener wrappers?

            A female dog has littered puppies in MA area.
            They wanted to use only females which had littered puppies.
            I've nipped at world leaders and littered puppies worldwide.
            When littered, the kittens are weak, blind, deaf, helpless little things.
            It is just unfortunate that the Cat littered in the box.
