            Syntax Is: NP1 PREVAIL[transitive] (OVER NP2)
            NOTE: in this sense, NP2 may be omitted. To test this sense, try to add &quot;over NP&quot;
            to the sentence.  If it is acceptable/natural/wouldn't make you cringe 
            if you heard it, then use this sense.
            EXAMPLE:
            okay: He has said he is confident that democracy will prevail (over other forms of government.) 
            not okay/weird: *Sunny skies will prevail (over cloudy skies.)
            NOTE: if the context is too ambiguous to determine the existence of NP2, choose sense 2.

            Syntax Is: NP1 PREVAIL[intransitive]
            Note: suggests that NP is prevalent, and therefore may have some influence
            in a given context, but not that it necessarily defeats opposing forces
            NOTE: if unsure of the inference of victory, choose this sense (see last example)
