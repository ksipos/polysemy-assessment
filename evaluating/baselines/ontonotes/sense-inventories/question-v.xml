            NOTE: Please compare to sense 2 carefully, particularly in examples of 
            &quot;question why, whether, how&quot; etc.  Both senses can be used in this
            frame. It is up to the tagger to look at the context and use
            intuition to decide if information is being sought (sense 1) or if
            doubt and challenge are involved  (sense 2).
