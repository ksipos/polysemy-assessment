            I was repaid in full within the week.
            We will repay the loan.
            Do we have any debts to repay? 
            You have visited my blog a few times recently and I've not repaid the visit!

            We can never repay your kindness.
            You hard work will be repaid with success.
            I will study diligently and conscientiously, and will repay you with my good grades.
            Thank you. I hope to repay you for your kindness.
