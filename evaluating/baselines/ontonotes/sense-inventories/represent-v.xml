            NOTE: compare carefully to sense 1.  In sense 1, the symbol and the item
            represented are separate 'entities'; in this sense, the representing item shows
            the represented item in particular form. (The &quot;young girl&quot; is actually the &quot;wife&quot;
            at an earlier time, the content of the &quot;report&quot; is the &quot;current situation&quot; (abstract)
            in a written (concrete) form.)
