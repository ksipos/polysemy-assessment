            Syntax includes: NP1[agent] SNEAK (PP) NP2[object] (PP)
            Includes: SNEAK IN, SNEAK OFF WITH
            NOTE: Includes the subsense 'to steal'. The PP always occurs, but
            can occur before or after NP2 and usually doesn't encode motion in
            the way it does in sense 1. The emphasis is on NP2 not the
            motion of NP1 or 2.
