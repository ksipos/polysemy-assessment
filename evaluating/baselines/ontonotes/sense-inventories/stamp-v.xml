            NOTE: Includes metaphorical uses. Compare carefully to sense 4. In
            the [concrete] examples, a concrete INSTRUMENT (a rubber stamper)
            is being used to 
            produce an image on another concrete item (a letter/wax for
            example), but the instrument is not permanently attached to the item. 
            NOTE: Compare to Sense 4; Sense 3 is NOT the affixation of a
            postage stamp.
            INCLUDES: STAMP OUT

            NOTE: This is a subsense of sense 3. In this sense a concrete item
            (a postage stamp) 
            is being permanently attached to another concrete item (a letter,
            for example). Use this sense ONLY if this specific condition is met.

            Note: Compare to Sense 3; in Sense 5, the agent must be a group of
