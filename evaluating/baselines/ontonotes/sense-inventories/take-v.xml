            Syntax is: NP1[agent] TAKE NP2[activity] (PP)
            NOTE: compare carefully to "light verb" usage (sense 2)
            In this sense, the NP2 cannot be paraphrased
            as a verb.
            EX:  "They have taken steps to avoid confusion," can NOT be paraphrased
            as "They have stepped to avoid confusion."
            NOTE: Do NOT substitute synonyms for the NP2.  ie, do not sub "photograph" for "picture"--
            "Take a photograph of X" can become "Photograph X" (sense 11) but "Take a picture"
            does not mean "Picture X" (and so is sense 1, not sense 11).  While the meaning of "take a 
            picture" and "take a photograph" are synonymous, we are using this approach for the sake
            of consistency.

            NOTE: compare carefully to "carry out, enact (sense 1)
            In this sense, the NP2 CAN be paraphrased
            as a verb. (So the verb "take" does not really
            contribute meaning to the sentence.)
            EX:  "She took a bath," CAN be paraphrased
            as "She bathed."  She is really bathing, not 
            taking anything.

            Note: If it is not one of the following multi-word expressions, please
            mark the instance as None of the Above.
            Note: ONLY choose this sense for the phrases listed below. Please
            check carefully. Extra modifiers may be added, but be sure the basic sense is the same.  For
            example, "take a big chance" would count as an instance of "take a chance."  However, "take
            a leave (from her job)" is not the same as "take leave (of his grandmother)" and should not be
            tagged with this sense.
