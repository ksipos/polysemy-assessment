        Another possible sense: 'The herd watered.' This was suggested in tagger
        feedback but seems to be just a reflexive version of sense 1.

            Syntax includes: NP1[agent] WATER NP2[patient]
            NP1[agent] WATER NP2[concrete]
            
            NOTE: Compare to sense 3. The NP being watered does NOT experience
            a change of state. Also the NP2 does not need to be explicitly
            stated as being living (as in example 2) but a living thing always
            occurs as a result (i.e. the field contains living plants).

            Syntax is: NP1[agent] WATER DOWN NP2[concrete]
            NP1[agent] WATER DOWN NP2[abstract]

            Note: Includes metaphorical examples. Compare to sense 1. In this
            sense the NP being watered down experiences a change of state.
