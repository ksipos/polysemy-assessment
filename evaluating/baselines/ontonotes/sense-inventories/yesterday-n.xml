            The day immediately before today.  Twenty-four hours ago.
        </commentary>
        <examples>
            I walked to the bank yesterday, but it was closed.
            It seems like just yesterday that I fell down the stairs.
            It was in yesterday's newspapers.

        <commentary>
            The past as a general concept.  Usually the recent past.
        </commentary>
        <examples>
            Yesterday's solutions aren't going to work on the problems of today.
            The world of yesterday is a dark, scary place filled with barbarians.
            Historians are more concerned with yesterday than tomorrow.
