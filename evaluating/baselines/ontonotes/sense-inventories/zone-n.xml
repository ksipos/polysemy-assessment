            Agreed upon zones.  Mainly geographical, clearly defined with discrete boundaries.  Something that could conceivably appear on a map.

            I changed my watch after switching time zones.
            The South Temperate Zone is the area between the Antarctic Circle and the Tropic of Capricorn.

            area - 
            Used more frequently.  Word indicating space - not previously
            established.  Not demarcated by clear boundaries.  Metaphoric or vaguely-defined zones.

            You've entered my zone of control.
            During this game of tag, the safe zone will be from those trees to the swing set.
            Parachuters try to land on the drop zone.
            This is a tidal action zone.
