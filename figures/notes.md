* I do not have enough time to get any meaningful data for the text. I could put #docs/size as htmls but I do not think that its very useful. 
* I updated the code for ndcg, got all the vectors and their results from the pyramid kernel. The results are still behind the ground truths (higher gt: 0.88, lower gt: 0.84, higher pyramid: 0.83) and the random one is still getting above average results (averaging at 0.78). A small change (not sure if I have enough time to push it now) is that on the #ndcg average I should exclude the self-comparison because it adds to the total (wikipedia against wikipedia is adding +1/#baselines in the average). It is not significant but the pyramid's ndcg's score will be closer to these.
* I pushed everything on github. I got 2 version for the heatmap, one with and one without the best pyramid ranking. I have the code and the required files into the 'figures' folder (its a notebook).
